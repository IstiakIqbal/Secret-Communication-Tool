# Secret-Communication-Tool
This is an old project I developed while learning Python. This tool encrypts and decrypts messages using base64 encoding with Tkinter for the GUI. It allows users to encrypt messages with a key and decrypt them using the same key, providing a simple introduction to cryptography and GUI programming in Python.
